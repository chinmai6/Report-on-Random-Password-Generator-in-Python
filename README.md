Introduction
In this report, we will walk through a Python program that generates a random password based on user-specified length. 
The program uses a combination of alphabets (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and special characters to ensure the generated password is both secure and unpredictable. 
This password generator follows a 50-30-20 formula for distributing characters between alphabets, numbers, and special symbols. 
This report will explain the logic behind each step of the code and the reasoning for using specific functions.
